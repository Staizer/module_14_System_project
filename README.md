Algorith does not work as intended.

Is a combination of not having the correct format for the training text and not having the correct training algorithm in general.

My code is too inefficient with too many for loops. If I had more time I could try to develop different ways of addressing the need to filter my text, but I am just too inexperienced with different methods of extraction to have approached this the way I should have.

The other issue is that it was impossible to find data sets that would be good examples of that sort of files that I would be trying to match to. I ended up having to generate some file names of my own, but they are too uniform for it to be truly beneficial to train an AI on.

I was unable to get anything past the initial setup phase because of my issues and was only reminded of other options like rapidminer at the last moment.
